1. Include a wireframe of what your game project will look like. This wireframe is for the [MVP (minimum viable product)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of your application. Keep it simple!

1. How you will represent the game board in JS? Think about the layout of your gameboard, different data structures you can use, how you will interact with the board, and the logic that will be required to determine when the game is over.

**I plan to have 9 boxes of exaxt size for the tic tac toe board. The theme will be Halloween Colors and the goal is to have the functional requirements and a 3D effect on the gameboard. Maybe a hidden surprise if there is time**

1. How you plan to approach this project?

**Authentication and getting set up via GitHub day 1. Work on sign up -> sign up day 2 and maybe day 3. Revisiting this, definitely went into day 3. Day 3, functionality of the gameboard and day 4. Finalize with styling based off the wireframe.**

1. Include 4-8 user stories for your project (i.e. `As a < type of > user, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.`)

**Authentication**

As a user, I want < sign up with email, pw, pwc > so that < play >.
As a user, I want < sign in with email and pw > so that < I can play >.
As a user, I want < be able to change my password > so that < if I forget my password>.
As a user, I want < sign out> so that < my score can't be altered>.

**Game**

As a signed in user, I want to be able to start a new tic tac toe game
As a signed in user, I want to be able to add x to the board first
As a signed in user, I want turns to rotate between x and o
As a signed in user, I want to be only able to select open spaces
As a signed in user, I want to be told when there are 3 in a row for a win or a tie
As a signed in user, I do not want to be able to add to the board once the game is over
As a signed in user, I want to be able to play again
As a signed in user, I want to be able to see how many games ive played

**Version 2+**

As a < child > user, I want < to learn about animals > so that < I can pronounce animals earlier >.
As a < child> user, I want < have fun > so that < I smile when I'm using the app/website>.
As a user, I want < to keep score > so that < I can win >.
As a user, I want < to keep score > so that < I can win >.**

1. How you plan to keep your code modular?

**I will modularize my code by breaking up the authentication and the games apis/events/UIs. The project will remain on one css (scss) and one html.**

1. What creative spin will you add to your project?

**Halloween Themed**

1. How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

**Git Commit often but not when something is half-done. Plan to test before committing.**

1. What additional features will you build if you have extra time?

**Create pictures behind each box representing a monster and once you win maybe it a suggested costume to the winner. Costume to be picked randomly via a array.**

List of technologies used:

**HTML, CSS(SCSS), JavaScript, JQuery, JSON**

Problem Solving strategy, development process, planning:

**I relied on the issues board a lot to fix issues. A lot of people were having the same problems I was and looking at their code helped me find the solutions. Our professors were great in getting us to the right resource to solve our issues. Sometimes stepping up and guiding me in one on ones. The planning relied mainly on the get started and requirement schedule. Before tackling a project in the real world, its good to grab the customer/clients requirement list and really focus on the functionality of the site. Making it look nice only goes so far if it doesnt work.**
